## ðŸ“‹ Technical Implementation Details

### File Download Fix:
```typescript
// Enhanced file handling with proper encoding
const fileBuffer = Buffer.from(fileContent, 'utf8');
res.setHeader('Content-Type', fileData.mimeType);
res.setHeader('Content-Transfer-Encoding', 'utf8');
res.send(fileData.data.toString('utf8'));
```

### Multiple Submission Prevention:
```typescript
const [isCreating, setIsCreating] = useState(false);
const [uploadProgress, setUploadProgress] = useState('');

const handleCreateOrder = async (e) => {
  if (isCreating) return; // Prevent multiple submissions
  setIsCreating(true);
  // ... order creation logic
}
```

### Chat Reply System:
```typescript
const handleReplyToMessage = (message) => {
  setReplyingTo(message);
  document.getElementById('message-input')?.focus();
};
```

### Consistent Styling:
```css
.animate-fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-out forwards;
  opacity: 0;
}

.text-gradient-blue {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #3b82f6, #1e40af);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
}
